Dear AGA Past Presidents,

It was great seeing many of you at DDW in Chicago. Because of your strong commitment to the field, I wanted to make sure that you were aware of two opportunities to give back through the AGA Research Foundation.

DDW Named Session. By contributing $125,000 or more in unrestricted gifts to the foundation, you can have a  DDW session named in your honor for the next 10 years. At the recent DDW there were sessions named in honor of Martin Brotman, Michael Camilleri, and Dave Peura. We will add Don Castell to the list next year.

You will be credited for all cumulative past contributions to the foundation. The foundation staff contact your colleagues, friends and patients to bundle contributions towards a named session. If you are interested in learning more, please contact Stacey Tuneski at stuneski@gastro.org.

Sustaining Legacy Society. For a contribution of $2,000 or more, you can become a Sustaining Legacy Society member for this year. We hope that you would pledge to be sustaining member for five years with a gift of $10,000. For more information on how to become a Sustaining Legacy Society member, contact Stacey Tuneski at stuneski@gastro.org.


Thanks for your support.
Bob
