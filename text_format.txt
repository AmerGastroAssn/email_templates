Dear Dr. %%LAST%%,

As a voting member of the American Gastroenterological Association, you are invited to vote in the 2017 election. If you have already voted, we thank you and you may disregard this message. As required by the AGA Bylaws, the membership was solicited to propose themselves or other eligible members for the AGA Nominating Committee to consider. The nominating committee met on Jan. 28, 2017, and considered all eligible nominees. The committee’s selections are presented in the Councillors Slate and the Nominating Committee Slate.

A ballot is linked below, providing all voting members with the opportunity to vote by April 12, 2017, for candidates for basic research councillor, practice councillor, early career practice member of the 2017-2018 AGA Nominating Committee, early career research member of the 2017-2018 nominating committee, and for four of the eight remaining candidates for the 2017-2018 nominating committee. Please join us at the AGA Annual Business Meeting during DDW® in Chicago on May 8 at 2 p.m. in Room E350, McCormick Place, when the election results will be announced.

We are also pleased to announce the 2017-2018 officers. This is provided for your information only, not for voting.
